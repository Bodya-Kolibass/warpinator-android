# Warpinator for Android (unofficial)

This is an unofficial reimplementation of Linux Mint's file sharing tool [Warpinator](https://github.com/linuxmint/warpinator) for Android.

Implementation of the protocol is mostly complete (although sometimes buggy) but the UI still needs some work.

## Building

Build with Android Studio or with this command (you will need to install Android SDK yourself though):

```
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$HOME/Android/Sdk
./gradlew build
```
